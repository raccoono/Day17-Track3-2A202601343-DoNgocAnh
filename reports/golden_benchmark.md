### G09 - long_term

`<USER_SUMMARY> For personal projects, Minh prefers Python and the personal project is named ORCHID-27. For company projects, specifically BLUEBIRD-42, the backend must use TypeScript with NestJS, and Python is not to be used for this project. Minh is learning about async/await and coroutines versus Tasks in Python. Minh needs to complete a benchmark report by Friday at 4 PM (16:00), which is related to LAB-REPORT-1600. Minh is currently debugging async HTTP requests and has attempted to increase the timeout to 60 seconds without success, investigating connection pool, client lifecycle, and concurrency. A potential solution involves reusing an aiohttp ClientSession and setting concurrency to `
